# Introduction
## A brief overview into the project domain
- Marketing functions have always been playing a central role in the financial industry, especially in the banking sector
- Retail banks often used direct marketing as a telemarketing strategy to contact potential customers and sell their products
- Crucial for retail banks to ensure that they are targeting groups with a high chance of success

## What more could be done?
- Data analysis. Understand the consumers needs and preferences!
- Leverage on deep learning techniques to make better predictions

## What is the problem statement of the project?
- Retail banks urgently need a reliable and accurate machine learning model as a competitive advantage to help them predict customer intention to subscribe to term deposits
- Offerings of financial products like providing “term deposits” slightly vary from the other retail banks. In other words, every bank offerings are almost identical)

## Aims & Objectives (What do I aim to achive?) 🌟
**The Aims**
- The overall aim of this project is to enhance retail banks’ marketing effectiveness and reduce marketing costs through the development of a reliable deep learning machine learning model to accurately predict bank clients’ possibilities in subscribing to bank term deposit. 

**The Objectives**
- To identify features that play a major role in affecting the bank clients’ intention to subscribe to the bank term deposit. 
- To develop a reliable deep learning technique and predict bank clients’ intention to subscribe to a financial product - bank term deposit.
- To evaluate the performance of the deep learning models with the evaluation metrics benchmarked by past studies.

# Initial Data Exploration & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Finding out the following: 
  - What is the data shape? 
  - Are there any missing values? 
  - How many categorical / numerical variables are there?
  - What is the dependent variable, how's the distribution? 
  - Are there any class imbalance issue? 
  - and many more...!
- EDA --> Univariate Analysis & Bivariate Analysis
